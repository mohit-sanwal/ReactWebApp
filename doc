1. npm i react react-dom
// webpack and webpack-dev-server
2. npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli
// babel
+ babel-preset-react@6.24.1
+ babel-preset-env@1.7.0
+ babel-core@6.26.3
+ html-webpack-plugin@3.2.0
+ babel-loader@8.1.0

3. npm i --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react html-webpack-plugin


For those wanting to use babel-loader 8+: it requires Babel 7.x,, which is to be installed as the '@babel/core' package instead of 'babel-core'. In other words, run:

npm install --save-dev @babel/core

Q: what is babel-core,  babel-preset-react, babel-preset-env, html-webpack-plugin, babel-loader



npm clean-install :
error: when webpack-dev-serve is not considered as an internal or external command.
